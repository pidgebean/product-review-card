## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While coding this project I learned quite a bit about css grid and how to get things to look right on different screen sizes. 


### Continued development

While this project looks good at width:375px and width:1440px, betweent those two boundaries it doesn't look right. So I am going to mess with it some more so that it looks good no matter the screen size.
